# Contributing To FGame Version 1
:+1::tada: First of all I thank you for the free time to contribute!

I thank you again for the free time you have given to contribute. With your contribution, it is hoped that this project will be better.
Please be able to maintain the language of speech and manners.

## What do I need to know to start contributing to this project?
### C++ Programming Language
All of these products are made using the C++ programming language. And I hope you can use C++ programming language. 
The C++ built in this project is simple and doesn't involve writing complicated code for beginners.
Included in this project are as follows:
- Management in memory. Because this project uses C++ then you should be able to manage the memory used to improve performance.
- Always use commands to tell people what you're doing.
- C++ compiler can use C++ version 17, because this project uses filesystem library in this project code.

### Tools Used For This Project
#### Linux
- Usually I use GNU Compiler (**g++**), but you can use **clang** or something else.
- **cmake**, this is needed to generate the makefile and make it easier for you to compile the code later. The thing to remember is that cmake must be more or equal to version 3.7

## Code style
You should be able to keep your code neat and not broken here and there. 
And you should make comments to tell people what you do and the logic you use.
And hope the comments do not contain words that are not expected in the development of this project.

## Pull Request
When you want to do a pull request, you have to make what you do. 
And you have to explain what you're doing, with examples of you improving something or adding a feature. 
And can be sure that your code can be run in the target platform in this project.

## Commit
For a moment, if you have completed the target or problem, you will definitely commit your code. 
Therefore you have to make the commit with the emoji in front of the dititle statement. 
And you have to make whatever you do in the decryption field.

### Emoji
Like the statement above you have to create an emoji to tell what you're doing.
And below to show you what emojis are used to tell the code what you're doing.
- :lock: `:lock:` This shows the code that you commit to tighten the code
- :bomb: `:bomb:` This shows the code that you commit to remove or delete the (**code** / **directory**)
- :memo: `:memo:` It shows the code that you commit to notify there are changes or updates to the code
- :shirt: `:shirt:` This shows the code that you committed to notify you of any additions or updates to the documentation
- :bug: `:bug:` This code tells you the commits that were made to let you know how to fix errors or bugs.
- :bangbang: `:bangbang:` This code tells you the commits that were made to let you know what's missing.
- :white_check_mark: `:white_check_mark:` This emoji is to indicate your commit to add a file or example
